We have decided to design a website for a loan company.  This website will consist of at least four pages, which are: Home, About Us, Product and Contact. On the main page, that is the home page, a slide will display images, highlighting the major types of loans the company offers. They are Tuition Loans, Vehicle Loans, Back to School Loans, and Pay Day Loans.  Alongside this, a message will be displayed, welcoming users to the website and giving them a brief description of why the company’s purpose.  On the product page, there will be a calculator.  The user can use it to assist them in the knowing what loan they can afford while giving a outline of the monthly payment and the total amount payable. The users will be able to select the type of loan they are interested in, as well as be able to enter the amount they want to borrow. For each loan selected, the calculator will display how long the loan should take to repay as well.
The header banner of the website will be seen always while on the website no matter how the user scroll. This, we believe, is a promotional tactic to remind users of the company’s name.  

Implementing the calculator on the product page might be our biggest challenge. We have built calculators before but not like this one. However, we a determine and motived to get it done. We are researching extensively, to ensure that this obstacle is crossed. And all our mile stones are met. Some of which are getting the input from the users, fixing errors and invalid inputs, fixing cells and converting strings to numbers or numbers to strings. The slide show on the home page will use a for loop method to get the pictures to change. The colors we wish to use for the website are blue, purple, white, and grey. The colors may change as the project progresses. 
We wish to make use of media sizing so that the website will appear unformed on devices such as phones and tablets. Our decision to go with this project is purely motivational. It seemed like a good chance to learn something new while gaining good practice.  The hope is that this project will show our creativity and motivate us and my fellow class mates.
